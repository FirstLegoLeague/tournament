		<h1>How to design a page?</h1>

		<h2>When you start thinking about how a page should look, you need to keep a couple of things in mind:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>What will the page look like when using screens of different sizes? Whic screen sizes should this screen fit?</li>
			<li>What is the flow of actions in this screen? UX experts tell us that the flow should of action should follow the flow of reading - from left to right, and from top to bottom.</li>
			<li>If the screen has many object, maybe it would be better to split it into several screens, i order to not overwhelm the user.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>So when should I use each layout component?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Use <code>grid</code> a lot, it helps devide the page easier.</li>
			<li>Use <code>menu</code> a lot, it is the basic element for actions, and very helps to organize.</li>
			<li>Use <code>tabs</code> to organize your pages easily.</li>
			<li>Use <code>topbar</code> when you need to have a similar look in all pages, with the same menus and actions.</li>
			<li>Use <code>secondary topbar</code> if you use the <code>topbar</code> and want stuff to change between pages. The <code>secondary topbar</code> is meant to have all the secondary actions.</li>
			<li>Use <code>off-canvas</code> only when the usage of its content is quick, like accessing different pages. Don't use it, for example, for complex query building. In this cases, you should use <code>grid</code> together with <code>toggler</code>.</li>
		</ul>
